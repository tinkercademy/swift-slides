## What is inclusive design?

- Design with consideration for the wide variety of human experiences and circumstances behind each user
- This includes differences in disability, but also gender, race, culture, and technological access
- Inclusive design enables app designers — that's us — to design experiences for more potential users, no matter their circumstances
