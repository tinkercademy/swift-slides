# Plan your prototype
### Aim: To figure out how your app will work, and what the user experience will be.

---

## User Flows
- User flows shows the journey a user takes when using your app
- Here is an example user flow of an e-commerce app:
    - User opens app
    - User taps on recommended product
    - User taps "buy now”
    - User receives order & delivery information

---

## Sketch a Low-Fi Prototype
- First, choose a user action you want to prototype.
- Next, draw 1 - 3 screens for this action.
- Repeat with other actions!
- In Freeform, draw 3 simple prototype screens
- You can refer to the example Bug Buzz prototype on Slide 19 of the App Journal for inspiration.

---

## Low-Fi Prototype
- Focus on layout, not the graphics, colour, and fonts
- The aim is to create quick, *throwaway* designs that you can use for discussion
- You shouldn't feel bad throwing them away and starting again!

---

# Sketch your storyboard

---

## Sketch a Storyboard
- Duplicate the storyboards in Freeform, and work out how you navigate from one screen to another.
- As you're doing this, think:
    - Are there any buttons and actions missing? Add them in, and figure out what they do.
    - Would it be easier to move things onto their own screens? Feel free to edit your storyboard!
- In Freeform, duplicate the 3 screens and create a storyboard using them
- In the App Journal, complete slide 18 and 19

# App behaviour

---

## Work out App Behaviour
- Duplicate the storyboard sketches, and work out what changes on- screen and off-screen for each user action
    - This helps you figure out how an app behaves behind the scenes — key information for building your app!
- Examples:
    - Does the app save anything?
    - Does a new screen pop up?
    - Does the app pull any data from online?
- In Freeform, duplicate your storyboard and use sticky notes to show the app behaviours
- In App Journal, fill in slide 20 and 21

# Design

---

## Design Style, Icon, and Name
- It's time to personalise your app!
    - Choose a colour scheme. Try out [tk.sg/colours](https://tk.sg/colours) for ideas and to learn about colour theory.
    - Work out a design style — how will your icons look? Colourful or monochromatic colours? Realistic or symbolic styles?
    - Sketch an icon. It should be simple, recognisable, distinct, and preferably not contain any text.
    - Choose a name!
- In Freeform, create a few sample app icons
- In the App Journal, fill in slide 23 and 26.
