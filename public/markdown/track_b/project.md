# Project Brief

---

## Single-Feature iPad App
- As a group, create a Single-Feature app that solves a problem, opportunity, or solution.
- This app should be **one feature** that solves the problem well.
- There are many apps on the App Store that do exactly that, they do one thing, and one thing really well.
    - It's quality over quantity.

- This is literally a clicker app with 3 controls—next button, previous button, and a slider to exit.
    - If you really think about it, it's a 2-key wireless keyboard.
- But it solves a problem, and does it's job really well.
- It makes it quick and easy to connect a clicker to a presentation.
- You can take a look at it on the App Store at [oak.jiachen.app](https://oak.jiachen.app).

## Think Simple
- Don't overthink.
- You don't need dozens of different features to solve a problem, focus on one—the one with the most impact. 
- Sometimes, the simplest one is the best.

---

# Brainstorm & Plan
## Where do we start?

---

## Generate Ideas
Using the project Keynote, generate ten ideas in 10 minutes for an app that makes your day — or someone else's — better.

---

## Hear from Others
Ask three to five people to look at your app ideas and identify the idea they like best.

---

## Rapid Prototyping
Rapid prototyping helps you think creatively about what your app could look like or how it could work.

Use the blank templates provided in the Brainstorm and Plan section of the project Keynote to sketch five rapid prototypes in 15 minutes.

These prototypes are designed to be quick and rough. The goal is to get your idea across.

---

## Prototype Feedback
Show your designs to at least three people and ask for feedback.

---

## Combining Prototypes
Using the feedback you collected, decide on a design to move forward with.

This design can be one of the prototypes, or a combination of multiple.

---

# Keynote Prototyping
## It's more than a presentation software

---

## Prototyping
- Bring your selected idea to life with a Keynote Prototype.
- Use the blank slide provided in the Keynote Prototype section of the project Keynote to make your prototype. Duplicate the
slide if needed.
- Check out the slides below covering Keynote tools like _hyperlinks_, _animations_, and more that can help to bring your prototypes to life.
- This prototype should be as similar as possible to the eventual app you'll be developing.
- Take a look at [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms) for information about designing experiences on iPad.

---

# Evaluate
## What do others think?

---

## Show it Off!
Show your Keynote prototype to at least three people!

Ask users to fill out the feedback form in the Evaluate section of the Keynote.

---

## Consider Their Feedback
Make changes to your prototype based on what you heard.

---

# Development
## Coding Time

---

## Get Started!
- Create your project
- Work together in your team
- Break up your project into smaller components that each person can work on individually on their iPad, then combining it all together by sharing the code with one another.
    - As it is not possible to collaborate with Swift Playgrounds on iPad, consider sharing code through tools like [Notion](https://notion.so), a chat platform of your choice, or uploading it to [code.tk.sg](https://code.tk.sg) and sharing the unique link with others in your team.
